                <h3 class="section-title"> Decline in gasoline demand with the rise of electric vehicles </h3>
                <p class="visibleparagraph"> Many countries are setting ambitious goals to reduce carbon emissions, leading to a gradual decline in gasoline demand. <b>Electric vehicles (EVs)</b> are becoming more popular, supported by government incentives and advancements in battery technology. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="visibleparagraph"> Electric vehicles are gaining momentum in the United States and China, with <b>increasing demand for decarbonization in 2024</b>. Hence, the gasoline demand is slowing down with the increasing production of electric vehicles. The expanding penetration of electric cars in the automotive industry is anticipated to lower the demand for gasoline by 50 percent in 2024.  (Anand, 2024) </p>

                <h3 class="section-title"> Technological Advances in Fuel Efficiency and Emissions </h3>
                <p class="visibleparagraph"> Fuel efficiency is a <b>must</b> for every driver. As it determines the money you can save, your car's driving range, and the long-term performance of your vehicle. Fuel efficient vehicles <b>require less gas</b> to go a given distance. When we burn less gas, we <b>cut global warming emissions and produce less pollution</b>, while spending less on gas—a lot less. Improving the fuel efficiency of US vehicles is the single biggest step we can take to cut the country's oil consumption (Transportation Technologies and Innovation, n.d.) </p>

            <h3 class = "section-title"> Tips in improving fuel efficiency which lead to lesser emissions (Canada.ca, 2024)  </h3><ul>
                <li class = "visibleparagraph"><b>Accelerate gently</b> - The harder you accelerate the more fuel you use. In the city, you can use less fuel by easing onto the accelerator pedal gently. To be as fuel-efficient as possible, take 5 seconds to accelerate your vehicle up to 20 kilometres per hour from a stop. Imagine an open cup of coffee on the dashboard. Don’t spill it!</li>
                <li class = "visibleparagraph"><b>Maintain a steady speed</b> - When your speed dips and bursts, you use more fuel, and spend more money, than you need to. Tests have shown that varying your speed up and down between 75 and 85 km per hour every 18 seconds can increase your fuel use by 20%. Consider using cruise control for highway driving, where conditions permit.</li>
                <li class = "visibleparagraph"><b>Anticipate traffic</b> - Look ahead while you’re driving to see what is coming up. Keeping a comfortable distance from the vehicle in front helps maintain a steady speed and reduces fuel consumption.</li>
                <li class = "visibleparagraph"><b>Avoid high speed</b> - Keep to the speed limit to save fuel. Most vehicles are most fuel-efficient between 50 and 80 km per hour. At 120 km per hour, a vehicle uses about 20% more fuel than at 100 km per hour.</li>
                <li class = "visibleparagraph"><b>Coast to decelerate</b> - Use coasting instead of braking to slow down. This helps conserve fuel by maintaining your vehicle's momentum.</li></ul>

                <h3 class="section-title"> Opting for cleaner alternatives </h3>
                <br><img src="Gasoline Website/depletion.png" height="200" alt="Depletion of Fossil Fuels" class="section-img">
                <br><p class="visibleparagraph">Fossil fuels are <b>limited in quantity</b>, which means that we cannot go on using them. Alternative fuels are obtained from renewable sources, which makes them a suitable substitute for fossil fuels. Examples of alternative fuels are hydrogen, ethanol and biodiesel.</p>
                <br><img src="Gasoline Website/biofuelss.jpg" height="200" alt="Synthetic and BioFuels" class="section-img">
                <br><p class="visibleparagraph">The <b>rise of biofuels and synthetic fuels</b> is presenting alternatives to traditional gasoline. These options aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels. </p>
                <br><img src="Gasoline Website/hydrogenpower.jpg" height="200" alt="Hydrogen Power" class="section-img">
                <br><p class="visibleparagraph"> Another material which scientists are opting for is <b>Hydrogen power</b>. It is a promising alternative fuel option for clean mobility – many experts see it as the fuel of the future. This highly efficient fuel cell technology turns hydrogen gas into electricity without generating emissions other than water vapor. </p>

                <hr class="divider">
                <p class = "visibleparagraph"It is evident that <b>Alternative fuels</b> are preferred because they are renewable in nature. They are also environmentally friendly in use and cost-effective in production. They are attractive from a waste management perspective. These fuels are intended to provide improved performance and lower emissions.</p>
