                <p class="visibleparagraph">A fossil fuel that is extracted from beneath the surface of the Earth is petroleum. In shallow oceans with high pressure, a mixture of plants, algae, and sediments forms reservoirs. Seismic surveys are used to help discover oil resources, and oil drilling is the main recovery technique. Petroleum is extracted from wells by oil rigs and platforms, and it is subsequently refined to produce gasoline and other goods. On the other hand, extraction can be risky and lead to oil spills.</p>

                <p class="visibleparagraph">Seismic surveys are used by geologists to locate potentially oil-containing geological formations. While passive methods use naturally occurring seismic waves, traditional methods create subterranean explosions to measure seismic reactions. Oil can be found with the use of additional tools such as magnetometers and gravimeters.</p>

            <div>
                <p class="visibleparagraph">Oil extraction and recovery processes can be categorized into three stages: primary, secondary, and enhanced recovery. These techniques are aimed at maximizing the amount of crude oil extracted from reservoirs, with primary recovery relying on natural reservoir pressure, secondary recovery using methods like water or gas injection to maintain pressure, and enhanced recovery applying advanced methods such as steam or chemical injection to mobilize more stubborn oil deposits.</p>

            Primary Recovery:

                    <p> Recovers 5–15% of the reservoir's oil by using natural processes to raise it to the surface. Among the methods are the use of artificial lifting devices like pumps and valves to collect oil.</p>

                    <p>Used when the pressure in a natural reservoir drops. In order to improve extraction rates, fluids (such as gas or water) are injected to raise pressure. A further 30% of the oil may be recovered as a result, increasing the overall recovery to 35–45%.</p>

                    <p>By increasing the mobility of heavier oil, methods like steam injection or the use of surfactants enable an extra 5–15% recovery. For efficiency, cogeneration plants are frequently used in this procedure. Microbial treatments are also explored to make oil easier to recover.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Refining process</h3>
                <p class="visibleparagraph">Petroleum refineries convert crude oil into usable petroleum products, such as fuels for transportation, heating, paving, and electricity generation, as well as feedstocks for chemical production. The refining process breaks crude oil down into its components, which are then reconfigured into new products. All refineries operate through three basic steps: separation, conversion, and treatment.</p>

            <div>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">1. Separation</h3>
                <p class="visibleparagraph">Modern separation begins by heating crude oil in furnaces, allowing the resulting liquids and vapors to flow into distillation units. All refineries utilize atmospheric distillation units, and more advanced facilities may include vacuum distillation units. Inside these units, liquids and vapors separate into fractions based on boiling points: - Light fractions (gasoline and liquefied gases) rise to the top and condense into liquids. - Medium-weight fractions (kerosene and distillates) remain in the middle. - Heavier fractions (gas oils) settle lower, with the heaviest components at the bottom.</p>

            <div>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">2. Conversion</h3>
                <p class="visibleparagraph">Following separation, heavier distillation fractions undergo further processing to become lighter, higher-value products, such as gasoline. This transformation relies on various methods, primarily cracking, which uses heat, pressure, and catalysts (sometimes hydrogen) to break heavy hydrocarbon molecules into lighter ones. Cracking units feature tall reactors connected to furnaces and heat exchangers. Complex refineries may utilize different types of crackers, including fluid catalytic cracking and hydrocracking units. Other conversion processes, like alkylation, rearrange molecules instead of splitting them, creating gasoline components from gaseous byproducts of cracking. Reforming involves using heat, moderate pressure, and catalysts to convert naphtha into high-octane gasoline components.</p>

                <p class="visibleparagraph">Both incoming crude oil and outgoing refined products are temporarily stored in large tanks near the refinery. Pipelines, trains, and trucks transport the finished products from these storage facilities to various locations across the country.</p>
