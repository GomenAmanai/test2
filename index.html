                <p class="visibleparagraph">Gasoline, mixture of volatile, flammable liquid hydrocarbons derived from petroleum and used as fuel for internal-combustion engines. It is also used as a solvent for oils and fats. Originally a by-product of the petroleum industry (kerosene being the principal product), gasoline became the preferred automobile fuel because of its high energy of combustion and capacity to mix readily with air in a carburetor.</p>

                <p class="visibleparagraph">Edwin Dug the first crude oil well in Pennsylvania in 1859 and distilled the oil to produce kerosene for lighting. Although other petroleum products, including gasoline, were also produced in the distillation process, Drake had no use for the gasoline and other products, so he discarded them. It wasn't until 1892, with the invention of the automobile, that gasoline was recognized as a valuable fuel. By 1920, 9 million vehicles powered by gasoline were on the road, and service stations selling gasoline were opening around the country. Today, gasoline is the fuel for nearly all light-duty vehicles in the United States.</p>

He is best known for developing the method of catalytic cracking, which transformed the production of gasoline and other fuels. This process allows heavier fractions of crude oil to be converted into lighter, more valuable products, including gasoline, making it more efficient to produce high-octane fuels necessary for the growing automotive industry​.</p>
