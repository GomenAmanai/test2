        <p class="visibleparagraph">Gasoline is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons and other compounds. Its chemical composition can vary based on the source of crude oil, refining processes, and the specific formulation for different grades. Here are the primary components typically found in gasoline:</p>

Gasoline primarily consists of a variety of hydrocarbons, particularly alkanes (also known as paraffins). Alkanes have the general formula CnH2n+2 and can be subdivided into the following three groups: the linear straight-chain alkanes, branched alkanes, and cycloalkanes.</p>

They are also referred to as arenes or aryl hydrocarbons. They are an essential component of gasoline, contributing significantly to its octane rating and overall performance. These compounds contain one or more benzene rings in their molecular structure, giving them unique chemical properties. While aromatics improve fuel efficiency, they also have environmental and health risks.
